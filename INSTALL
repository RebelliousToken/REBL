Building REBL

Use the autogen script to prepare the build environment.

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

Always verify the signatures and checksums.

./configure --disable-tests --disable-zmq --with-boost-libdir=/usr/local/lib -- fix boost library

See doc/build-*.md for instructions on building rebelliousd,
the intended-for-services, no-graphical-interface, reference
implementation of REBL.
